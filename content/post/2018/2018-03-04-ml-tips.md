# Tips of Machine Learning

## Data

  - Quantity
  - Representation
  - Quality
    - outliers
    - missing features
  - Irrelevant Features
    - Feature selection
    - Feature extraction
    - Creating new features by gathering new data

## Algorithm

  - Overfitting: too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data.
    - regularization
    - simplify the model
    - reducing the number of attributes
    - gather more training data
    - reduce noise
  - Underfitting
    - more complex model
    - better features
    - reducing the regularization

## Testing and Validating

  - training set <--> validating set -finally->  testing set
  - cross-validation

  > If you make absolutely no assumption about data,then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other.
  - No Free Lunch, David Wolpert
